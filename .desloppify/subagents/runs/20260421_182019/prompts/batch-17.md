You are a focused subagent reviewer for a single holistic investigation batch.

Repository root: /Users/avion/Documents.nosync/projects/insider-trading
Blind packet: /Users/avion/Documents.nosync/projects/insider-trading/.desloppify/review_packet_blind.json
Batch index: 17
Batch name: design_coherence
Batch rationale: design_coherence review

DIMENSION TO EVALUATE:

## design_coherence
Are structural design decisions sound — functions focused, abstractions earned, patterns consistent?
Look for:
- Functions doing too many things — multiple distinct responsibilities in one body
- Parameter lists that should be config/context objects — many related params passed together
- Files accumulating issues across many dimensions — likely mixing unrelated concerns
- Deep nesting that could be flattened with early returns or extraction
- Repeated structural patterns that should be data-driven
Skip:
- Functions that are long but have a single coherent responsibility
- Parameter lists where grouping would obscure meaning — do NOT recommend config/context objects or dependency injection wrappers just to reduce parameter count; only group when the grouping has independent semantic meaning
- Files that are large because their domain is genuinely complex, not because they mix concerns
- Nesting that is inherent to the problem (e.g., recursive tree processing)
- Do NOT recommend extracting callable parameters or injecting dependencies for 'testability' — direct function calls are simpler and preferred unless there is a concrete decoupling need

YOUR TASK: Read the code for this batch's dimension. Judge how well the codebase serves a developer from that perspective. The dimension rubric above defines what good looks like. Cite specific observations that explain your judgment.

Mechanical scan evidence — navigation aid, not scoring evidence:
The blind packet contains `holistic_context.scan_evidence` with aggregated signals from all mechanical detectors — including complexity hotspots, error hotspots, signal density index, boundary violations, and systemic patterns. Use these as starting points for where to look beyond the seed files.

Mechanical concern signals — investigate and adjudicate:
Overview (7 signals):
  design_concern: 6 — src/analyzer/analysis.py, src/analyzer/cli.py, ...
  mixed_responsibilities: 1 — src/analyzer/database.py

For each concern, read the source code and report your verdict in issues[]:
  - Confirm → full issue object with concern_verdict: "confirmed"
  - Dismiss → minimal object: {concern_verdict: "dismissed", concern_fingerprint: "<hash>"}
    (only these 2 fields required — add optional reasoning/concern_type/concern_file)
  - Unsure → skip it (will be re-evaluated next review)

    summary: Issues from 3 detectors — may have too many responsibilities
    question: This file has issues across 3 dimensions (orphaned, smells, structural). Is it trying to do too many things, or is this complexity inherent to its domain? Is this file truly dead, or is it used via a non-import mechanism (dynamic import, CLI entry point, plugin)?
    evidence: Flagged by: orphaned, smells, structural
    evidence: File size: 232 lines

RELEVANT FINDINGS — explore with CLI:
These detectors found patterns related to this dimension. Explore the findings,
then read the actual source code.

  desloppify show orphaned --no-budget      # 6 findings
  desloppify show smells --no-budget      # 11 findings
  desloppify show structural --no-budget      # 1 findings
  desloppify show unused --no-budget      # 4 findings
  desloppify show unused_enums --no-budget      # 2 findings

Report actionable issues in issues[]. Use concern_verdict and concern_fingerprint
for findings you want to confirm or dismiss.

Phase 1 — Observe:
1. Read the blind packet's `system_prompt` — scoring rules and calibration.
2. Study the dimension rubric (description, look_for, skip).
3. Review the existing characteristics list — which are settled? Which are positive? What needs updating?
4. Explore the codebase freely. Use scan evidence, historical issues, and mechanical findings as navigation aids.
5. Adjudicate mechanical concern signals (confirm/dismiss with fingerprint).
6. Augment the characteristics list via context_updates: positive patterns (positive: true), neutral characteristics, design insights.
7. Collect defects for issues[].
8. Respect scope controls: exclude files/directories marked by `exclude`, `suppress`, or non-production zone overrides.
9. Output a Phase 1 summary: list ALL characteristics for this dimension (existing + new, mark [+] for positive) and all defects collected. This is your consolidated reference for Phase 2.

Phase 2 — Judge (after Phase 1 is complete):
10. Keep issues and scoring scoped to this batch's dimension.
11. Return 0-10 issues for this batch (empty array allowed).
12. For design_coherence, use evidence from `holistic_context.scan_evidence.signal_density` — files where multiple mechanical detectors fired. Investigate what design change would address multiple signals simultaneously. Check `scan_evidence.complexity_hotspots` for files with high responsibility cluster counts.
13. Workflow integrity checks: when reviewing orchestration/queue/review flows,
14. xplicitly look for loop-prone patterns and blind spots:
15. - repeated stale/reopen churn without clear exit criteria or gating,
16. - packet/batch data being generated but dropped before prompt execution,
17. - ranking/triage logic that can starve target-improving work,
18. - reruns happening before existing open review work is drained.
19. If found, propose concrete guardrails and where to implement them.
20. Complete `dimension_judgment`: write dimension_character (synthesizing characteristics and defects) then score_rationale. Set the score LAST.
21. Output context_updates with your Phase 1 observations. Use `add` with a clear header (5-10 words) and description (1-3 sentences focused on WHY, not WHAT). Positive patterns get `positive: true`. New insights can be `settled: true` when confident. Use `settle` to promote existing unsettled insights. Use `remove` for insights no longer true. Omit context_updates if no changes.
22. Do not edit repository files.
23. Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences.
